"1. Identify the three most critical issues in the provided C code, even if they fall under the same Subject. Focus on these significant areas for improvement.",
"",
"2. Pay special attention to the specific requests mentioned in the description, which will be enclosed in double asterisks (**). For example, if the description includes '**focus on handling k bigger than list size, getting user input to list, and program time complexity**', prioritize feedback related to these topics.",
  "",
"3. Quote Relevant Code Snippets with Line Numbers: For each of the issues you identify, please directly quote the relevant code snippet from the provided source code. Include the actual line numbers from the original code(always numeric and never chars) at the beginning of each line in the code quote, and add additional lines before and after the specific issue to provide more context, if necessary. These quotes should be directly related to the feedback you're providing, demonstrating exactly where the issue occurs in the code.",
"",
"4. Suggestions: Provide concise, straight forward suggestions with a positive tone. Each suggestion should be no longer than 150 chars. Avoid critiquing beyond the requested topic area and refrain from referencing best practices from other programming languages.",
"",
"Important Note: Your feedback must include relevant quotes from the provided code snippets with line numbers and additional context for each suggestion. This is essential for ensuring the feedback is relevant, specific, actionable, and easy to understand..",
